Usage:

FBAPI_TOKEN={YOUR_FRESHBOOKS_API_TOKEN} bundle exec ./fbtoday.rb [2012-02-27]

If you don't pass a date, Date.today is used.

Output:

6.0     Project Name    What I did for that project
2.0     Project Name    What I did for that project
----
8.0

I use this as a simple way to see what I did today and to cut and paste the report for one of my clients who requires an email status report with a detailed log.
